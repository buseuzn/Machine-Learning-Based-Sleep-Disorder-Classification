This paper aims to classify sleep disorders existence based on the daily habits of the participants. Since 
sleep health is an important topic for the physical and psychological well-being of society, it is valuable to grasp the 
primary factors for future public health strategies. 

For classification, Logistic Regression is used as a statistical 
model, while Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM 
are used as machine learning models. Finding the best model for this classification is a great interest in this paper. Hence, several 
performance metrics are compared, such as F1 scores and accuracy. Feature importances of the best resulting model were 
also obtained.
